## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media query

### What I learned

Took me almost 3.5 hours to finish this easy level since I am getting familiar with using flexbox and trying to improve the structure of HTML semantic and the use of CSS. 

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - This helped me for finding a specific question. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
